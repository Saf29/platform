## Getting started

- [How to set up Tribe development environment](https://github.com/tribehq/platform/wiki/How-to-set-up-Tribe-development-environment)
- [Git Flow](https://github.com/tribehq/platform/wiki/Tribe-Git-Flow)

## Coding Guidelines and Development üõ†

- Ensure you stick to the [Golang Effective Go Coding Standards](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Run our build process described in the document on [how to set up Tribe development environment](https://github.com/tribehq/platform/wiki/How-to-set-up-Tribe-development-environment), it will install our pre-commit hook, code sniffs, dependencies, and more.
- Whenever possible please fix pre-existing code standards errors in the files that you change. It is ok to skip that for larger files or complex fixes.
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code supports the minimum supported versions of Golang.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the Tribe Platform repository.
- Make sure to write good and detailed commit messages (see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more on this) and follow all the applicable sections of the pull request template.
- Please avoid modifying the changelog directly. These will be updated by the Tribe core team.
